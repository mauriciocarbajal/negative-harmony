Negative harmony: https://youtu.be/DnBr070vcNE?t=2m21s
This is a simple tool to explore negative harmony in a decent time (of course, if you happen to be other than Jacob!).

If you want to use it, just require it as a node module (see index.js, should be pretty straightforward).


## Usage:
`findOppositeChord('C',['E','Ab','B','D']);`

That will give you the opposite chord of an E7 chord (in the 'C' tonality)
